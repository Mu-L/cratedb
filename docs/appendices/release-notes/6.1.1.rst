.. NOTE::

    In development. 6.1.1 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.

.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 5.0.0 or higher
    before you upgrade to 6.1.1.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 6.0 release before moving to
    6.1.1.

    A rolling upgrade from >= 6.0.2 to 6.1.1 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 5.x will not function with 6.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 6.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

series.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused ``EXPLAIN ANALYZE`` on queries using a sub-query
  returning multiple-rows (like with ``WHERE x IN (SELECT ...)``) to not release
  the memory accounted within the query circuit breaker. This could later on
  result in queries getting rejected with a circuit breaker exception, despite
  having memory available.

- Fixed an issue where generated and default sub-columns were missing from
  results returned by the ``RETURNING`` clause.

- Fixed an issue that led to deleting persisted
  :ref:`pg_catalog.pg_stats <pg_stats>` during full cluster restart, thus making
  it necessary to run again :ref:`analyze`.

- Disallowed generated sub-columns within object arrays or referencing their
  sub-columns, which is unsupported and leading to errors or wrong behavior.

- Fixed an issue with ``atttypid`` column of the ``pg_attribute`` table not
  being reset to ``0`` for dropped columns, which contradicts with the
  PostgreSQL behavior.
