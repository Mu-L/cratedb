.. NOTE::

    In development. 5.10.0 isn't released yet. These are the release notes for
    the upcoming release.


.. NOTE::

    If you are upgrading a cluster, you must be running CrateDB 4.0.2 or higher
    before you upgrade to 5.10.0.

    We recommend that you upgrade to the latest 5.9 release before moving to
    5.10.0.

    A rolling upgrade from 5.9.x to 5.10.0 is supported.
    Before upgrading, you should `back up your data`_.

.. WARNING::

    Tables that were created before CrateDB 4.x will not function with 5.x
    and must be recreated before moving to 5.x.x.

    You can recreate tables using ``COPY TO`` and ``COPY FROM`` or by
    `inserting the data into a new table`_.

Performance and Resilience Improvements
---------------------------------------

- Added hash-join execution for left-outer-equi-joins. This improves performance
  for left-outer-join with an equi-join condition significantly with the cost of
  higher memory consumption e.g.::

    SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 OM t1.id = t2.id;

  This optimization can be disabled, with the session setting::

    SET rewrite_left_outer_join_to_hash_join = false

  Note that this setting is experimental, and may change in the future.
